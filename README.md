## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how people react to popular brands on Twitter by performing sentiment analysis on **12,447 manually cleaned tweets**. The analysis is based on four sentiment categories:

- ✅ Positive  
- ⚪ Neutral  
- ❌ Negative  
- 🚫 Irrelevant

Unlike many projects that use black-box sentiment models like VADER, this study focuses entirely on **statistical interpretation** and **data visualization**, making the results more transparent and explainable.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze real-world Twitter sentiment using manual data and statistical tools.
- Apply **descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing**.
- Use **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** and **Excel** to produce clean, clear visualizations.
- Avoid reliance on automated NLP tools to ensure **human-centered interpretability**.
